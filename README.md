Final Auction Version

Today, on the day of project presentation, we are uploading our MotorBid ASP.NET.MVC3 group project along with 
all documentation to this newly created repositories.

As it was stated previously by email, our old repository with extension ..autoauction.git became unmanageable
due to conflicting references, which resulted based on updates made by both of us, such as commmiting MvcAutoAuction
files (e.g. models, views, controllers, dal, bll) from different machines. Earlier docummentation commits made by us, 
where one of us commited MvcAutoAuction (MS Visual Studio) project updates, whereas other person added .doc and .pdf
files as part of documentation didn't harm original git repository until the moment when both of us started sinchronizing 
MvcAutoAuction project by sending updates from our own laptops. One other major concern that resulted in a serious damage
on working project application, happened when 'git pull' cmd was used. It created a lot of exception errors. One of us 
was fortunate enough to have Backup copy of the project for save retrieval to avoid unnecessary headache with unexpectedly 
damaged application as a result of unsuccessful sinchronization between local machine and remote git repository.

You may still access old repository to check on dates when progress was made by each of the group members, however, final
and working version of MvcAutoAuction project (including Unit Tests) is transfered to this repository along with all 
related documentation:
